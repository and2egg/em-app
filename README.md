# Energy market application


This application is part of my diploma thesis called "Cost aware resource management in distributed cloud data centers". 
It features a standalone application server which continually retrieves data from energy markets and provides forecasts based on this data. 
These price forecasts can be used in a cloud simulator (or possibly in a real cloud as well) where possible cost reductions due to changing energy prices in distributed data centers are investigated. 
It incorporates an R server which makes use of the powerful statistical tool R (see <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">here</a>) to build models and forecast data accordingly.
